Chat app
 
install node.js (follow intructions on the link below)
http://nodejs.org/#download

Though it's not necessary you have to install the mysql modules:

install npm (node gem-like package manager):
$ curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sudo sh

run
$ npm install mysql

if you want you can use the mysql database to store the chat logs
but it must have the following definitions:
db_name = serious_beats
user = serious
password = beats

to run the chat app
$ node server.js (runs on port 5000)
